> **Note**
> The original Repo is the starting point for the project. Ultimately, the goal is to add more features that distinguish the project from the original.
> We will give back to the original Repo where it makes sense, but as updates have not happened in several year we have to assume the project is no longer maintained.

# VS Code Add Code of Conduct

## Code of Conduct
A Code of Conduct is a set of rules for a group of people to follow when they interact with each other on behalf of a project, community, or event. Adding a Code of Conduct to your repo is a great way to show inclusivity for all contributors and provide clear guidelines for how to behave and how the rules will be enforced.

This extension will add a Code of Conduct to your repo. By default, it will use the [Contributor Covenant](https://contributor-covenant.org/). Our goal is to always provide the latest version, currently [v2.1][covenant-latest].

As development continues and other options for Codes of Conduct are discovered, additional options may be provided.

## How to Add a Code of Conduct to Your Repo
- Activate the Command Pallet
- Select the `Add Code of Conduct` Command
